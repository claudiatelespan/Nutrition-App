Simmer on medium-high heat until the center of the potatoes are tender when pricked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Turn off heat. Drain, return potatoes to pot and allow to completely dry out over remaining heat. Mash with a potato masher until smooth. Place warm mashed potato in medium bowl. Stir in flour, salt and melted butter. Mix lightly until dough forms. On a well floured surface, knead the dough lightly. The dough will be sticky. Use a floured rolling pin to flatten into a 9 inch circle about 1/4 inch thick. Cut into quarters using a floured knife. Sprinkle a little flour into the base of the skillet and cook the farls for 3 minutes on each side or until evenly browned. Season with a little salt and serve straight away.",

        "directions": "Whisk cider vinegar, vegetable oil, and salt together in a small bowl. Combine cabbage, scallions, and cilantro in a separate bowl. Pour vinegar mixture over top and toss to coat; set cabbage slaw aside. Combine chili powder, salt, coriander, cumin, and pepper in a bowl. Pat fish dry and rub with vegetable oil. Rub fish evenly with spice mixture. Place fish on a wire rack and refrigerate until grill is ready. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat with the lid down for 10 to 15 minutes. While the grill is heating, combine mayonnaise, 1/2 of the lime juice, chipotle peppers, and garlic in a small bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. Scrape the hot grill grate until clean. Dip a paper towel in vegetable oil and quickly rub it over the grate. Lay fish on the grill, perpendicular to the bars of the grate. Cook until fish is opaque and flakes apart when gently prodded, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 5 minutes. Tear fish apart into a bowl and pour remaining lime juice over top. Place several tortillas in a single layer on the grill and cook until warm, about 10 seconds per side. Transfer to a tortilla warmer and repeat to warm remaining tortillas. Smear warm tortillas with mayonnaise mixture, then add fish, cabbage slaw, and queso fresco.",

        "directions": "To Make Sauce: Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Blend in salt, pepper and flour, then stir in the milk and Romano cheese. Simmer, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. To Make the Garlic Butter: Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Blend in the garlic, rosemary, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, until garlic is tender but not browned. Remove from heat, cover and set aside. To Make the Dough: Pour the warm water into a small bowl and stir in the yeast until dissolved. Allow to rest until yeast foams, about 5 minutes. Mix the vegetable oil, sugar, salt, rosemary, and garlic powder together in a mixing bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture, and gradually stir in the flour. Gather into a loose ball and knead until a smooth ball forms. Cover, and let rest 1/2 hour. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Season the roasted chicken with rosemary, thyme, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and salt. Chop or shred and reserve. To Assemble the Pizza: Spread dough out on prepared pizza stone. Top with cooled garlic butter, covering entire crust. Next spread with   (if necessary, warm to spreading consistency), leaving crust edges. Top with chicken, turning to coat with sauce. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until bottom crust is lightly browned. Remove from oven and let set for 2 to 3 minutes before cutting.",

Cut along both sides of the backbone from the tail to the neck; remove backbone. Make a 1/4-inch-deep cut through the piece of cartilage in the center. Open up both sides to reveal breastbone; lift out. Cut chicken in half through the center line. Place both halves in a resealable zip-top bag and pour in the buttermilk marinade. Place the bag in a bowl to catch any leaks. Press air out and seal. Marinate in the fridge for 6 to 18 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove chicken from marinade and transfer onto a paper towel-lined plate. Blot off excess marinade. Place chicken on the grill cut-side down, skin-side up; cover and cook for 20 minutes. Flip chicken over and continue grilling for 7 to 10 minutes. Flip once more and grill until no longer pink in the center, about 15 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).",

        "directions": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the baguette into 24 rounds. Brush bread rounds lightly with olive oil. Place bread rounds on a baking sheet. Toast the bread rounds in the preheated oven just until crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Meanwhile, slice Brie cheese into 24 equal pieces. Remove toasted bread from oven; top each round with a slice of Brie cheese. Return the crostini to the oven to melt the cheese, about 5 minutes. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. In an ovenproof casserole, stir together the oysters, butter, any remaining olive oil, salt, and pepper. Broil in the preheated oven until the oysters begin to curl at the edges, about 5 minutes. Remove the oysters; place one oyster on top of each crostini. Top the crostini with red pepper strips; serve warm.",

        "summary": "Fresh, sweet taste, so much better than store-bought, and so easy! Use these marinated peppers as an antipasto, or a very healthy sandwich filling. Experiment with different herbs such as rosemary or Italian seasoning. My favorite is basil. Marinade also makes a wonderful salad dressing when the peppers have been eaten!",
        "directions": "Set an oven rack about 4 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place bell peppers, skin side-up, on the prepared baking sheet. Broil peppers in the preheated oven until skin is blistered and blackened, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove peppers from the oven and immediately transfer to a plastic or paper bag, seal, and set aside for 20 minutes. Peel off blackened skin and cut peppers into 1/2-inch strips. Combine olive oil, garlic, balsamic vinegar, salt, basil, and seasoned pepper in a wide-mouth jar and shake until marinade is well blended. Place pepper slices into the jar, shake, and refrigerate until fully cooled and flavors have melded, 3 hours to overnight.",
